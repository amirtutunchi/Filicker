# Filicker
Awesome project in SwiftUI, Combine and Viper Architecture

This project is one of the most exciting projects that I work. Because it contains so many cool parts like working Viper and SwiftUI and Combine at the same time

## Running Project
I just use SPM so after opening Xcode and opening the project and downloading dependencies you are good to go
- I am using Swfitlint but I comment out the run script so you don't force to install Swiftlint

## Architecture
I use viper with Swiftui and Combine framework for doing this challenge. my main reason for choosing viper is it gives you more flexibility and more testability. It was so much valuable and interesting for me. I always try to push limits and using this architecture is so much funüçªüçª

## Unit-Tests
As you can see I tried to write some unit tests but unfortunately test coverage is not high. I try my best in approximately six hours and I continue writing more tests on a diffrent branch in order to go an extra mile.

## CI/CD
For CI as you can see i used github action to build and run tests when ever anything commit on main branch

## Conclusion
I really appreciated any suggestion you have regarding code and implementation and overall it was a fun journey ü§ù .
